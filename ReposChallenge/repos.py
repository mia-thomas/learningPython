''' A program that prompts for a list of repositories

Add each item to an array

Loop through the array and using the GitHub API, check if those repositories already exist and print to the user if the repo exists or not

Bonus ( not sure if it can be done with API but probably can ), when checking if repo exists, if it doesn’t then ask the user if they want it to be created, if they do then create the repo '''

print("hello world")
